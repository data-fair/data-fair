// Typed request-scoped context, replacing ad-hoc mutation of req properties.
// Pattern follows @data-fair/lib-express session.ts / site.ts: symbol keys,
// typed accessors, casts contained in the factory, get() throws when the
// middleware that sets the value was not applied.
// Accessors are defined topically, next to the code that owns the context
// (e.g. reqSettingsParams in settings/middlewares.ts) — see the placement
// table in docs/architecture/code-conventions.md §2. This module only hosts
// the factory and req-free context helpers.
