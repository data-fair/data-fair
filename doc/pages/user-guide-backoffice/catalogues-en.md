Connectors allow you to interact, read and write, with other platforms or data services.

With the writing interaction, metadata is pushed into other catalogs.  
An example of a catalog is the French National Open Data Catalog [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/) : datasets published with Data&nbsp;Fair can be **automatically synchronized** and any metadata changes on Data&nbsp;Fair are propagated to the remote catalog.

With the reading interaction, connectors are harvesters of metadata and data.  
It is  possible, for each connector, to configure the collection frequencies and the types of sources to harvest.

### Data.gouv.fr catalog configuration

Here is the configuration of the Koumoul organization's data.gouv.fr catalog :

Links to datasets and visualizations correspond to the pages of your portal to which you wish to redirect visitors who are going to navigate to your portal.

The **API key** to be entered corresponds to the key you generate on your [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/) account in your personal space :
